# dependencies-module
This python code is a replacement of traditional ``requirements.txt`` file. Add ``dependencies.py`` in your project as a Python module and add the chunk of code in ``example.py`` file in your Python script replacing the libraries for the ones you need and your project dependencies will be installed in Python automatically.
